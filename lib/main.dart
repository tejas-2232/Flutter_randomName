//Stateless widgets are immutable, meaning that their properties can't changeâ€”all values are final.

//Stateful widgets maintain state that might change during the lifetime of the widget

/*. Implementing a stateful widget requires at least two classes: 1) a StatefulWidget that creates an instance of a State class.
  The StatefulWidget object is, itself,
  immutable and can be thrown away and regenerated
 , but the State object persists over the lifetime of the widget. */
